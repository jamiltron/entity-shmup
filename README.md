ENTITY SHMUP
============

This is an attempt to learn [Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/) by writing a
small shmup in it with [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).

I am sharing the code to not be exemplary of how you should use an
Entity-Component system, but to (hopefully) help me learn by getting criticisms.

You will need the latest jars for artemis and libgdx 0.9.7+
